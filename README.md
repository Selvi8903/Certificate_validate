# Certificate_validate

E-Certificate Validation and Verification system ensures secure and  reliable verification of electronic certificates. Users upload certificates (e.g., NPTEL) on our website, which undergo thorough validation checks using internal criteria .Valid certificates are stored securely on Firebase and Pinata, with their hash values recorded on the Ethereum blockchain via Remix for immutable verification.

This integration with IPFS and Ethereum guarantees certificate integrity, as any tampering would alter the hash value and invalidate it against the blockchain record The system includes user-friendly modules for certificate management: a view module for easy access to uploaded certificates and a verification module for validating authenticity using stored blockchain data.
 
This approach provides a robust solution for digital certificate validation, prioritizing security, reliability, and user accessibility.
